# Vietnamese Chatbot

Welcome to our Vietnamese Chatbot project! This repository contains the code and resources to build a chatbot for the Vietnamese language using the transformer architecture in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our chatbot is designed to handle various tasks, answer questions, and engage in meaningful conversations in Vietnamese.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent and interactive chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like responses in Vietnamese. We utilize the transformer model, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture in the field of NLP, to achieve this objective. The chatbot is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversations:** Engage in interactive and dynamic conversations with the chatbot.
- **Multi-Task Handling:** The chatbot can handle a wide range of tasks including answering questions, providing recommendations, and more.
- **Context-Aware Responses:** Responses are generated considering the context of the conversation, resulting in more natural interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for building the chatbot.
- **Tensorflow:** Deep learning framework utilized for implementing the transformer model.
- **Transformers Library:** Leveraged for accessing pre-trained transformer models.
- **FastAPI:** Web framework used for building the chatbot's user interface.
